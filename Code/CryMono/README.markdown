#### Source directory structure 
Our Visual Studio projects have been set up to expect all contents to be placed inside a folder within the Code folder shipped with the CryENGINE Free SDK.

Example:
C:\CryENGINE\Code\CryMono

Using another folder structure is up to the developer, but will require customization in order for reference and output locations to be correct.
